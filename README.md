GitHub brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software.


They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. 
A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. 
Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.



Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists.
For the installation of Git and GitHub on Windows, here is a link to a YouTube video where it is well explained :https://youtu.be/J_Clau1bYco
